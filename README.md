# presidential_cadidate_markov_chain
A Speech Generator for Presidential Candidates.

This repository includes the dataset pulled from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/kinguistics/2016-us-presidential-primary-debates

Data can be found in the primary_debates_cleaned.csv.

The Markov Chain code itself can be found in the candidate_markov_chain.ipynb. This jupyter notebook includes a small amount of exploratory data analysis. After this I create a markov chain for Donald Trump. I then generalize this for all candidates and apply the generalized function to some of the top candidates :)
